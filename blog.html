                        <p class="moreabout">THE UNBORN BABY was in trouble. Its mother’s doctors, at a UK hospital,
                            knew there was something wrong with the fetus’s blood, so they decided to perform an
                            emergency C-section many weeks before the baby was due. But despite this, and subsequent
                            blood transfusions, the baby suffered a brain hemorrhage with devastating consequences. It
                            sadly passed away.

                        <p class="moreabout"> It wasn’t clear why the bleeding had happened. But there was a clue in the
                            mother’s blood, where doctors had noticed some strange antibodies. Some time later, as the
                            medics tried to find out more about them, a sample of the mother’s blood arrived at a lab in
                            Bristol run by researchers who study blood groups.</p>

                        <p class="moreabout"> They made a startling discovery: The woman’s blood was of an ultrarare
                            type, which may have made her baby’s blood incompatible with her own. It’s possible that
                            this prompted her immune system to produce antibodies against her baby’s blood—antibodies
                            that then crossed the placenta and harmed her child, ultimately leading to its loss. It may
                            seem implausible that such a thing could happen, but many decades ago, before doctors had a
                            better understanding of blood groups, it was much more common.</p>

                        <p class="moreabout"> Through studying the mother’s blood sample, along with a number of others,
                            scientists were able to unpick exactly what made her blood different, and in the process
                            confirmed a new set of blood grouping—the “Er” system, the 44th to be described.</p>

                        <p class="moreabout"> You’re probably familiar with the four main blood types—A, B, O, and AB.
                            But this isn’t the only blood classification system. There are many ways of grouping red
                            blood cells based on differences in the sugars or proteins that coat their surface, known as
                            antigens. The grouping systems run concurrently, so your blood can be classified in each—it
                            might, for instance, be type O in the ABO system, positive (rather than negative) under the
                            Rhesus system, and so on.</p>

                        <p class="moreabout"> Thanks to differences in antigens, if someone receives incompatible blood
                            from a donor, for example, the recipient’s immune system may detect those antigens as
                            foreign and react against them. This can be highly dangerous, and is why donated blood needs
                            to be a suitable match if someone is having a transfusion.</p>

                        <p class="moreabout"> On average, one new blood classification system has been described by
                            researchers each year during the past decade. These newer systems tend to involve blood
                            types that are mind-bogglingly rare but, for those touched by them, just knowing that they
                            have such blood could be lifesaving. This is the story of how scientists unraveled the
                            mystery of the latest blood system—and why it matters.</p>
